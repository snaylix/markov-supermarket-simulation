# Supermarket Simulation
a program that simulates customer behaviour in a supermarket using Markov chains and Numpy


# TO DO

User Story
- "I want a visualisation where I can enter the number of customers I see going to the supermarket, and then an animation shows me how all of these people would move through a hypothetical supermarket."


## Scripts
1. Script that combines 5 days of data into one:
  - Combine 5 datasets
  - Rename customer IDs to be unique
  - Add lines for missing checkouts
  - Add lines for missing entrances
  - Add lines for missing timestamps
  - Shifted location column
  - Output: df
2. Build transition matrix (6x6)
3. Implement a Markov Chain-based simulator
  - for one customers
  - for many customers
4. Write program for visualisation
  - create supermarket layout
  - create one customer
  - create many customers
  - create movements for customer
  - create boundaries for movemen
  - take care of stacked customer problem
  - slow down the animation



## Deliverables
1. Data viz/report for stakeholders
2. Markov Chain Model
3. Visualisation of model
