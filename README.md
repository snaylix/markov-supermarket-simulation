# Supermarket Simulation
a program that simulates customer behaviour in a supermarket using Markov chains and Numpy


# TO DO

User Story
- "I want a visualisation where I can enter the number of customers I see going to the supermarket, and then an animation shows me how all of these people would move through a hypothetical supermarket."


## Scripts
1. Script that combines 5 days of data into one:
  - Combine 5 datasets
  - Rename customer IDs to be unique
  - Add lines for missing checkouts
  - Add lines for missing entrances
  - Add lines for missing timestamps
  - Shifted location column
  - Output: df
2. Build transition matrix
3. Write program for visualisation



## Deliverables
1. Data viz/report for stakeholders
2. Markov Chain Model
3. Visualisation of model
